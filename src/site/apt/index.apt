EventBus 

   The EventBus is a simple but powerful publish-subscribe API that is based on class semantics 
   and/or string (topic) matching.  The EventBus works well in general purpose usage and has extensions 
   for UI development.

Why use the EventBus?

  The publish/subscribe pattern is commonly used to decouple components, make testing easier, and program by contract.  It replaces 
  the tight coupling introduced by explicit listeners with a flexible loosely coupled design. The EventBus is production ready and 
  used in many applications, including financial UIs, scientific simulations, and the most popular Java desktop application, Limewire.
  The EventBus is well tested and has very good documentation.
  
Project Status

  EventBus 1.x is stable, well tested, well documented and suitable for general purpose Java applications and Swing UIs.  
  
  EventBus 2.x is a work in progress. It will use the newly acquired org.eventbus package and will be extended to other UI toolkits 
  and RIAs such as Ajax and Apache Pivot.
