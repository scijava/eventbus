/**
 * The core interface.  An EventService provides publish/subscribe event services to a single JVM.
 * <p>
 * The EventService publishes {@link EventServiceEvent}s for type-safe event listening or publishes
 * any object on a topic name (String).  See package documentation for usage details.
 * <p>
 * Subscribers are subscribed by event class or topic name.
 * <p>
 * Subscribing an EventSubscriber to an EventServiceEvent class subscribes a subscriber to be notified on the publication
 * of an EventServiceEvent class or any of its subclasses. Optionally, EventSubscribers can be subscribed the exact
 * class (and not subsclasses) by using the {@link #subscribeExactly(Class, EventSubscriber)} method.
 * <p>
 * Similarly, an EventTopicSubscriber can be subscribed to a specific topic name, or a RegEx Pattern such that a
 * subscriber will be notified whenever an event is published on a topic name that matches the subscribing pattern.
 * <p>
 * A single subscriber cannot subscribe more than once to an event or topic name.  EventService implementations
 * should handle double-subscription requests by returing false on subscribe().  A single EventSubscriber can subscribe
 * to more than one event class, and a single EventTopicSubscriber can subscribe to more than one topic name or pattern.
 * A single object can implement both EventSubscriber and EventTopicSubscriber interfaces.  Subscribers are guaranteed
 * to only be called for the classes and/or topic names they subscribe to.  If a subscriber subscribes to a topic and
 * to a regular expression that matches the topic name, this is considered two different subscriptions and the
 * subscriber will be called twice for the publication on the topic.  Similarly, if a subscriber subscribes to a class
 * and its subclasses using subscribe() and again to a class of the same type using subscribeExactly(), this is
 * considered two different subscriptions and the subscriber will be called twice for the publication for a single event
 * of the exact type.
 * <p>
 * By default the EventService only holds WeakReferences to subscribers.  If a subscriber has no references to it, then
 * it can be garbage collected.  This avoids memory leaks in exchange for the risk of accidently adding a listener and
 * have it disappear unexpectedly.  If you want to subscribe a subscriber that will have no other reference to it, then
 * use one of the subscribeStrongly() methods, which will prevent garbage collection.
 * <p>
 * Unless garbage collected, EventSubscribers will remain subscribed until they are passed to one of the
 * unsubscribe() methods with the event class or topic name to which there are subscribed.
 * <p>
 * Publication on a class or topic name can be vetoed by a {@link VetoEventListener}.
 * All VetoEventListeners are checked before any EventSubscribers or EventTopicSubscribers are called.
 * This is unlike the JavaBean's VetoPropertyEventListener which can leave side effects of half-propogated events.
 * VetoEventListeners are subscribed in the same manner as EventSubscribers and EventTopicSubscribers.
 * <p>
 * Subscribers are called in the order in which they are subscribed by default (FIFO).  This is also unlike Swing, where
 * event listeners are called in the reverse order of when they were subscribed (FILO).
 * <p>
 * This simple example prints "Hello World"
 * <pre>
 * //Create a subscriber
 * EventTopicSubscriber subscriber = new EventTopicSubscriber() {
 *    public void onEvent(String topic, Object evt) {
 *        System.out.println(topic+" "+evt);
 *    }
 * });
 * EventBus.subscribe("Hello", subscriber);
 * EventBus.publish("Hello", "World");
 * System.out.println(subscriber + " This is just to make sure the subscriber didn't get garbage collected, not necessary if you use subscribeStrongly()");
 * </pre>
