/**
 * A ServiceLocator pattern class for getting an instance of an EventService.
 * Nothin' fancy, since the EventService is intended for a single VM. Allows mulitple
 * named EventServices to be discovered.
 * <p>
 * Holds the singleton Swing event service, which is wrapped by the EventBus,
 * which is mapped to the service name SERVICE_NAME_EVENT_BUS ("EventBus").
 * <p>
 * Since the default EventService implementation is thread safe, and since it's not
 * good to have lots of events on the EventDispatchThread you may want multiple EventServices
 * running on multiple threads, perhaps pulling events from a server and coalescing them
 * into one or more events that are pushed onto the EDT.
